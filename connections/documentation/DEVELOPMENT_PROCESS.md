# Development Process #

## Overview ##

My approach to solving this task and building the integration can be summarised as a 4 steps process:
1. Understanding the lifecycle of an online card payment transaction 
2. Understanding how Stripe implements the lifecycle of an Auth & Capture transaction
3. Review the starter code to understand the requirements
4. Develop each required method
   * Code
   * Test
   * Refactor

### Payment Ecosystem and Stripe ###

First of all I tried to understand at a high level what the online payment ecosystem looks like and how does Stripe fit into it. The most generic online transaction will involve 5 parties in a 4 corner model where the corners are:
* Cardholder (customer)
* Issuer (a bank providing the card to the customer)
* Merchant (accepting payment in exchange of goods/services)
* Acquirer (a bank enabling the merchant to receive payments)

At the center of the four corners there are the Card Networks (Visa, Mastercard) through which payment information and funds flow.

Stripe fits into this model with a dual role of Payment Gateway and Processor. As a Gateway, it offers software that encrypts credit card information on a merchantâ€˜s server and sends it to the acquirer. As a Processor, it facilitates the credit card transaction by sending payment information between the merchant, the issuing bank, and the acquirer.

### Transaction Phases ###

The next step was for me to get a sense of the various phases of a transaction, and how they are connected to the three method I was required to implement `authorize()`, `capture()`, `cancel()`

At the very minimum a transaction involves 3 phases:
1. Authentication - The identity of the Cardholder and the validity of the payment method is verified.
2. Authorization - A verification that the amount of funds required for the transaction is available for the specific payment method, and the funds are blocked 
3. Capture - The transaction is settled and the funds are transfered to the Merchant's account

Often 2 and 3 happen at the same time, but in our case we are creating an integration where Authorisation and Capture happen in two distinct moments, allowing for a Cancel option between the two actions, while the funds are blocked but not yet trasnfered.
